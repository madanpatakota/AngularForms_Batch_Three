1. i want to convert html control into angular control

ng-dirty    -> which represend the dirty 



disabled 
readonly
selected




required
email
minlength   = 3
maxlength   = 10 
pattern     = [atoz]  ----> mobile pattern


myownattributevalidation ---> we can doth atoz












<input type="text" disabled />  
<input type="text" required />  you should enter the value.
                                in case if you wo't give it will become as a invalid


terminology


formcontrol     ---> control(textbox,select, rsio,check)
formgroup       ---> collection of formcontols   ---- { }
formarray       ---> collection of formgroups    ---- [ ]
